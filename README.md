# Software for modeling the structure and evolution of autocatalytic networks 

Some of the algorithms that we have implemented are defined in Hordijk and Steel. 

We use the catlynet software developed in Daniel Huson's lab for visualizing autocatalytic networks.

Readers interested in the history of ideas in this field are directed to the following article.
